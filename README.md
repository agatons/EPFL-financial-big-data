#### Requirements
The project has a few libraries that are required in order for the run files to function properly. These libraries can be found in _requirements.txt_, just execute `pip install -r requirements.txt` in order to install the dependencies. The library _Ta-lib_ might be a bit tricky to install since it is a wrapper. Instructions on how to install it properly can be found [here](https://mrjbq7.github.io/ta-lib/install.html "Ta-lib install instructions").

#### Technical analysis method
